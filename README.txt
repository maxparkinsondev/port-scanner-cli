This is a simple port scanner CLI tool written in Python with the Scapy module.

Most code is based off of offcial Scapy documentation: https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

To use, simply call it with
 
 > sudo python3 scanner.py

No arguments are needed, all information will be entered in the user interface within the tool.

Tested and verified to work with Linux.
